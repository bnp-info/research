# Justin Sung's Mind Mapping

Justin Sung is ... He advocates the use of mind mapping, but has observed that the average learner does not advance their skills in this method and gives up on it in the end. This page is dedicated to Sung's insights on the practice of mind mapping.

## Three Levels of Mind Maps

According to Sung, there are three distinct levels of mind maps. I like to think of them as 'maturity' levels. Each level has basic criteria:

- Level 1: non-linear, has connections

- Level 2: grouping, relationships, flow

- Level 3: clear structure and flow, emphasis, intuitive labels

## GRINDE

Based on the three levels, Sung created a checklist to help ensure that your mind maps are of high-quality and thus high-value:

- Grouping - are individual concepts grouped for easier consumption?

- Reflective - does the mind map reflect what is happening inside your mind?

- Interconnected - are new and distant (nonobvious) connections represented?

- Non-Verbal - are pictures, arrows and symbols used in lieu of lots of words?

- Directional - is the logical flow of the thought process represented?

- Emphasized - 

## Psychology

- In a study, students performed best who combined inquiry with mind mapping.

- Shared mind maps produced by groups are also effective.

- Mind mapping increases motivation, memory, and creativity thinking.

- Bloom's Taxonomy

- Avoid framing bias by organizing information how it works for you.
