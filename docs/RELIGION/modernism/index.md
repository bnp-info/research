# Catholic Modernism

## Status: Planned

## Synopsis

The Latin Church -- what most people refer to as the Roman Catholic Church -- is currently divided with regard to her teachings. Some have made the serious accusation that the Church no longer professes the same faith that has been handed down to her by the Apostles, that she has essentially failed in her mission to preserve and protect the deposit of faith. That is, of course, if it weren't for the Traditional Catholic movement, the last 'remnant' of the true Catholic Church. This research topic has been undertaken with the intent to explore and explain the elements and nuances of both sides of the argument.

## Goals

1. Identify and understand the origin of modernism within the Church.

2. Compare and contrast with current understanding of the term.

3. Explore current Church practices and beliefs considered modernist.

4. Assess whether reportedly modernist practices are indeed danergous to the faith.

## Plan

1. Define 'Modernism'
   The findings of this research must be predicated on a correct understanding of what is meant by 'modernism' and the most obvious place to start is the writings of Pope Pius X, who in the early 20th Century wrote the most authoritative literature on the subject.

2. TBD
