# Pascendi Dominici Gregis

Encyclical of Pope Pius X

*On the Doctrines of the Modernists*

This is a summary of *Pascendi Dominici Gregis* promulgated by Pope Pius X on September 8, 1907. It concerns "Modernist" teachings that started to circulate within the Catholic Church at that time, how to identify them, how they impact the faithful, and how to supress them. The original text can be found [here](http://abc.org) and the paragraph numbers have been added in brackets below for quick cross-reference.

**Introduction**

* The papacy has the great duty of guarding the deposit of the faith. [1]

* There has never been lack of men promoting error; however, the number the enemies has increased exceedingly as of late. [1]

* Thus We may no longer be silent, lest We seem to be forgetful and fail in our duty. [1]

**Gravity of the Situation**

- Those seeking to teach error can now be found within the Church, both laity and clergy. [2]

- They call themselves reformers and they teach false doctrines. [2]

- They are surprised to be called enemies, but their danger is so great because they attempt to destroy the Church from within and so completely so. [3]

- They portray themselves as rationalists, yet Catholic, and are crafty deceivers. [3]

- They are often very active in the field of education and have reputations for strict morality. [3]

- They disdain all authority and teach without restraint for "the love of truth". [3]

- At first We showed them kindness in hopes that they would amend, but had to resort to more severe treatment and now, reluctantly, to public reproof. our efforts have been fruitless. [3]

- They must now be exposed so as to protect the Catholic name.

**Division of the Encyclical**

- We will first analyze their various methods of teaching as well as the errors themselves and their sources. [4]

- Then We will prescribe remedies. [4]

**Analysis of Modernist Teaching**

- Every Modernist has several personalities: philosopher, believer, theologian, historian, critic, apologist, and reformer. These roles must be clearly distinguished to understand their system and principles, as wellas the consequences of their doctrines. [5]

- Modernist thought is founded on the philosophy of Agnosticism [6]:
