# GitOps

## Executive Summary

"GitOps evolved from DevOps. The specific state of deployment configuration is version-controlled. Because the most popular version-control is Git, GitOps' approach has been named after Git. Changes to configuration can be managed using code review practices, and can be rolled back using version-controlling. Essentially, all of the changes to a code are tracked, bookmarked, and making any updates to the history can be made easier." [Wikipedia]
