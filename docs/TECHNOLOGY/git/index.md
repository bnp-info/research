The 'git' version control system is currently a way of life for software developers, especially for those who work on Open Source projects. Though I too have a professional need to learn about all things git, my intetest extends past this scope. I want to discover how the platform can be used for purposes beyond software development and by a greater number of people.

## Scope

- The 'git' version control tool and it's uses

- GitHub as a platform

- GitOps
