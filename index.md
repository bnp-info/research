## Welcome to my personal research page!

Some years ago, I sought a way to share online the topics I had been researching. I wasn't interested in manually maintaining a website, and while static website templates did exist, they weren't quite as sophisticated as they are today. So, I settled on a blogging platform, and this worked quite well for a while...until it didn't. Several serious problems arose over time with regard to how content was arranged and the planning involved for breaking very large topics into a series of smaller posts. In the end, I became dissatisifed with the workflow and realized that I had simply chosen the wrong tool for the job. I needed something more flexible that made it easy to move content around when necessary and allow it room to expand in unexpected ways.

And that is how this site came to be. No doubt, I still plan to blog about my progress and my findings, but this is where where the real research will reside.

The content on this site is topic-driven, as you can tell from the options in the menu above, and it will vary in format as needed.  Some pages will contain simple lists of currated references, while others will house research plans, aggregated notes, or source summaries -- really, whatever it takes to capture useful information to support my writing. And while I consider myself as my primary customer, I hope you find it useful too.
